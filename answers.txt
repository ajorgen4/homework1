What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

Merging combines 2 branches. If you had a branch to develop a new feature, and that feature is now complete, you would merge the branches. Both branch histories are
maintained, but they become one branch from that point on.

Rebasing moves the history of a source branch up the history of a target branch. It makes it appear as though the source branch had always started there by taking
the target branch commit it wants to look like it started from and reapplying the commits of the source branch from on it in a new branch. This keeps 2 branches,
but alters the history of the source branch. This is usually used before a merge operation to make the history more linear and easy to understand.
